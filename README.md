# AUTOMATED BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION FROM MRI IMAGES USING HYBRID CNN-VGG16

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for the automatic detection of brain tumors from MRI images.

## Overview

The proposed solution utilizes a modified version of the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is trained on a large dataset of MRI images with and without tumors. The model is optimized using various techniques, such as data augmentation, deep learning, and fine-tuning, to improve its accuracy and generalization ability.

The output of the model can assist doctors in the diagnosis of brain tumors, leading to more accurate and timely diagnoses and ultimately better patient outcomes. The proposed solution provides a promising approach for developing automated tools for the accurate and efficient diagnosis of brain tumors, which can have a significant impact on the healthcare industry.
